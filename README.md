# STAD80-Review-Thompson-Sampling-for-Complex-Online-Problem
We mainly investigate the background, algorithms, application of the algorithms, and difficulties for the multi-armed bandit problem. In addition, theorems and calculations about regret
are also included. Beyond the theoretical point of view, we practically applied two algorithms through R code: Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound and visualized the resulting plots. Based on this, we identify the limitations of
these algorithms, and discuss the algorithms and their future advancements.
